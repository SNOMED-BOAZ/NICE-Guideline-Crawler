[2009]'}, {'title': 'Recommendations for research', 'url': 'https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg81/chapter/Recommendations-for-research', 'content': 'Recommendations for researchThe 2014 and 2009 guideline committees made the following recommendations for research.1 Assessment of the role of exerciseWhat is the role of arm and shoulder specific exercises compared with and/or used as an adjunct to established lymphoedema treatments (such as compression garments and complex decongestive therapy)?Why this is importantWell-designed randomised controlled trials should consider differing arm and shoulder-specific aerobic and/or resistive exercises that focus on strength and flexibility to improve local lymph flow, for example, swimming, weight lifting, tai chi and yoga. The studies should have a follow-up period that is sufficient to capture long-term outcomes including changes to current lymphoedema or any new-onset lymphoedema in other parts of the limb. Outcomes for this research should include quality-of-life measures.[2014]2 Endocrine therapyClinical trials are needed to investigate the most effective endocrine therapy for postmenopausal women with ER-positive tumours who progress on treatment with an aromatase inhibitor.Why this is importantAlthough there is good evidence to support the use of aromatase inhibitors for postmenopausal women with ER-positive tumours, there is little evidence to determine what is the best sequence of alternative hormone treatments when they progress.[2009]3 ChemotherapyRandomised clinical trials should evaluate the clinical and cost effectiveness of different sequences of chemotherapy for advanced breast cancer.Why this is importantMost patients with advanced breast cancer who receive chemotherapy will be given at least two different regimens and many will receive three. The available evidence to support decisions about the most clinically and cost effective sequence in which to use these drugs is extremely limited. There is also very little good‑quality evidence about the relative clinical and cost effectiveness of currently recommended treatments, either in combination or in sequence. Following on from the recommendations in this guideline, it would be important to establish clinical trials to investigate this problem in a more systematic fashion than hitherto.[2009]4 Biological response modifiers (progressive metastatic disease)The use of continued trastuzumab in patients with progressive metastatic disease should be investigated as part of a randomised controlled trial. Trial design should incorporate collection of data required for prospective cost-effectiveness analysis.Why this is importantThere is currently no high-quality published evidence about whether continuing trastuzumab is effective in prolonging survival in patients with HER2-positive advanced breast cancer who develop progressive disease (outside the central nervous system) during or after first-line treatment with trastuzumab and cytotoxic chemotherapy. Any studies should be carefully planned to permit a high quality cost-effectiveness analysis.[2009]5 Biological response modifiers (adjuvant trastuzumab)Randomised controlled trials are needed to assess whether patients who have had adjuvant trastuzumab should be offered further biological response modifiers. Trial design should incorporate collection of data required for prospective cost-effectiveness analysis.Why this is importantAs more patients with HER2-positive advanced breast cancer have trastuzumab as part of their initial adjuvant treatment following a diagnosis of early breast cancer, an increasing number of patients with advanced breast cancer will have had previous exposure to this agent. There is no evidence currently about whether trastuzumab or other biological therapies are effective in this situation.[2009]6 Uncontrolled local diseaseThe relevant research organisations should be encouraged to address the topic of uncontrolled local disease and devise appropriate research studies. This might include development of a national register.Why this is importantThe problem of how best to manage uncontrolled local disease is very poorly addressed by the current evidence. Although it is probably quite an uncommon condition, it is likely that across the country there are enough patients to generate evidence from well-coordinated national studies. A national register should be considered as part of this because of the current uncertainties about the frequency of the problem.[2009]'}, {'title': 'Context', 'url': 'https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg81/chapter/Context', 'content': 'ContextBreast cancer is the most common cancer affecting women in England and Wales, with about 40,500 new cases diagnosed and 10,900 deaths recorded in England and Wales each year. In men breast cancer is rare, with about 260 cases diagnosed and 68 deaths in England and Wales each year (Office for National Statistics, Cancer statistics registrations: registrations of cancer diagnosed in 2005, England; Welsh Cancer Intelligence and Surveillance Unit, Cancer incidence in Wales 1992−2002). Of these new cases in women and men, a small proportion is diagnosed in the advanced stages, when the tumour has spread significantly within the breast or to other organs of the body. In addition, there are a significant number of women who have been previously treated with curative intent who subsequently develop either a local recurrence or metastases. Over recent years there have been important developments in the investigation and management of patients with advanced breast cancer, including new chemotherapy, and biological and hormonal agents. There is some evidence of practice variation across the country and of patchy availability of certain treatments and procedures. This clinical guideline helps to address these issues and offers guidance on best practice.'}, {'title': 'Finding more information and committee details', 'url': 'https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg81/chapter/Finding-more-information-and-committee-details', 'content': \"Finding more information and committee detailsTo find NICE guidance on related topics, including guidance in development, see theNICE topic page on breast cancer.For full details of the evidence and the guideline committee's discussions, see thefull guideline.
